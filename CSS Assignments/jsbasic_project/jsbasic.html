      <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
      lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a hose
      environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of those environments to provide programmatic control over
      them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
        a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <id="x">var x;</id></li>
        <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
        variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <id="x">var x = 10;</id></li>
        <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types
        that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <="x">true</id> or <id="x">false</id>; null - <id="x">null</id> aka nothin; Number - <id="x">42</id> or <id="x">3.14159</id>; String - <id="x">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</id>
        Array - <id="x">[1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</id> and Object - <id="x">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</id></li>
        <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
        values or conditions that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
        conditional statements: <id="x">if</id> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <id="x">else if</id> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
        condition is false; <id="x">else</id> we execute this block of code;</li>
        <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
          an action for some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
        <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
        insructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
        screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
        tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
